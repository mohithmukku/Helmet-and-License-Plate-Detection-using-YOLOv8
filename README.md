# Helmet-and-License-Plate-Detection-using-YOLOv8
This project detects individuals not wearing helmets and identifies vehicle license plates using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model. It supports image, video, and real-time (webcam) input, and can be used for safety monitoring in areas like traffic enforcement. The model is trained to detect helmets, the absence of helmets, and license plates.
